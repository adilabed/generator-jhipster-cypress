# JHipster Cypress

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application. It's goal is to provide End-to-End testing with [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/).

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/)

## üöÄ How to get started

The package is not published yet. So, to use it, you'll need: 
1. Make sure you have `yo` installed with `npm install -g yo`
2. Clone the package with `git clone https://github.com/clement26695/generator-jhipster-cypress.git`
3. Link the package with `cd generator-jhipster-cypress && npm link`

You can then use it in your JHipster application by:
1. Init the use of the module by running `yo jhipster-cypress`
2. Generate common E2E tests by running `yo jhipster-cypress:client`
3. Generate entity E2E tests by running `yo jhipster-cypress:entity-client`

In the future, cypress tests will be automatically generated when creating a new entity.

## üö¶ What we have now

‚ö†Ô∏è This module is in development and does not work out of the box yet. We will have to introduce special selectors in the JHipster templates to use this module out of the box.
